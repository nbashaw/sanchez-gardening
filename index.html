      <p>Sanchez Gardening was established when Raphael, after having worked his way up from 1985 to 1994, to a Supervisory position at the Oaks Mall, was suddenly laid off. Faced with the fear that being employed by a company would always carry this risk, Raphael decided that forming his own company would be easier and more secure ("Oh, the naivete!" he says now). With the strong encouragement of his wife and an established friendship with a man who worked at a nursery that became his first client and helped by handing out business cards to potential clients, Raphael slowly began growing his business.</p>
      <p>There were long hours and many uncertainties.</p>
      <p>It's been hard work, but Raphael has never been one to shy from that and with his own company, he always felt that he got from it as much as he put in.</p>
